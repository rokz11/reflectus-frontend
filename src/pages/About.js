        <p>
          ReflectUS is an intimate reflection space for partners.
        </p>

        <p>
          It exists for people who want to pause and look more clearly at their
          relationship — without pressure, diagnosis, or performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          ReflectUS does not sell therapy. It does not replace human
          conversation. And it does not promise quick fixes.
        </p>

        <p>
          It creates a structured space where reflection can happen without
          interruption, defensiveness, or the need to resolve anything
          immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most relationship tools instruct, diagnose, or try to fix.
        </p>

        <p>
          ReflectUS does something quieter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both partners reflect privately, without seeing each other’s words.
          Individual reflections remain fully private. What is shared is only a
          neutral reflection of emotional patterns, balance, and overall signal
          — never quotes, never blame.
        </p>

        <p>
          The system is intentionally non-invasive. It does not take sides. It
          does not tell you what to do.
        </p>

        <p>
          ReflectUS is built as a modular space.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first module offers a shared reflection between partners — a clear
          snapshot of the relationship as it appears right now.
        </p>

        <p>
          A second module, available as a paid extension, continues the process
          on an individual level. It introduces rhythm, boundaries, and agreed
          timing — because meaningful reflection needs structure to remain
          productive.
        </p>

        <p>
          This module supports depth and continuity over time, without turning
          the experience into therapy or self-help performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          ReflectUS uses advanced, purpose-built artificial intelligence,
          designed specifically for reflective processes between humans.
        </p>

        <p>
          It does not reassure or soften. It reflects only what is present and
          supported by what was shared.
        </p>

        <p>
          This often activates deeper thinking — not because the system
          “understands” you, but because it does not protect you from clarity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, changes in tone, engagement, and balance can be observed —
          without judgment or narrative.
        </p>

        <p>
          ReflectUS works best when its structure is respected.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reflection happens within agreed time windows. The process follows
          clear rules. Depth depends on sincerity, not eloquence.
        </p>

        <p>
          If engagement is shallow, that will be reflected. If one side
          disengages, that imbalance will be visible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nothing is exaggerated. Nothing is hidden.
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginTop: 24 }}>
          ReflectUS is not designed to impress. It is designed to be honest.
